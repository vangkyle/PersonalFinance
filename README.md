### Problem Statement


Personal finance is one of the most complicated task to keep track of for an individual; whether your too busy with other more important things in life or it gets too complicated to deal with. Personal finance could consist of monthly reoccurring bills like car, house and utilities or unexpected costs that appear without notice. From my own personal experience, I work, school and be a husband/father full-time, so it's hard to manage money efficiently. All I know is that my expenses are paid for and in time. Basically, the question I ask myself is "With the money earned, is it being spent efficiently?" and "What can I do to manage it better?".

I'm positive that if your able to keep up with these expense effectively, it will enable you to manage your money better to know what and how your money is spent on a monthly basis. I am sure that everyone today has struggle and donâ€™t seem to know where their hard earned money has gone to. I would like to build an application website that will allow users to log in to enter their income and expenses on a weekly basis, the application will be able to calculate how, what and where your finances are spent. The application will allow the users to track and view the usage of their money per month via the use of graphs and data tracking. In doing so, it will be a tremendous way to improve individuals that struggle with financial problems.
